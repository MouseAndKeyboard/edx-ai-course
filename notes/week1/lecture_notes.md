# Overview of AI lecture

**AI definition:** The study and design of intelligent agents where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximise its chance of success

## What is AI?

**4 schools of thought**
- Thinking Humanly
- Thinking rationally
- Acting humanly
- Acting rationally

### Thinking Humanly: Cognitive approach

Cognitive science perspective
Learn how humans think and then apply this to machines

### Acting humanly

Machines do things like humans
Alan turing

Turing test:
1. Human interrogator asks questions to a human and AI system,
2. Can the human interrogator differentiate

### Acting humanly

Behave mechanically like a human

### Thinking rationally

Codify thinking with logic
issues:
- Not all knowledge can be expressed with logical notations
- 

### Acting rationally

- Taking the correct actions:
  - The agent will attempt to maximise its expected outcome.
